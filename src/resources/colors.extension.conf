# This file is a non standard one to address the lack of missing chromosome colors for n > 24
# for some non mature karyotypes such as Dog, Cow and Horse.
# As non standard, may be modified in the future.
# In this version, they are based on Luminance-corrected chromosome palettes

# lum 70 - 70% luminance
# lum 80 - 80% luminance
# lum 90 - 90% luminance
