####Build and Test
This distribution includes Gradle for building and testing which is very easy to try.
Just use:

`./gradlew build`
[gradlew.bat on windows]

This will build a directory (build/libs) containing a jar package managing all needed dependencies.
 


`./gradlew test`  
this will trigger unit tests including some GUI integration tests that will also demonstrate you some 
of the package capabilities.
